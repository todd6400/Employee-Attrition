# Employee-Attrition
The purpose of this project was to create a regression model and tree model for a mock company to determine how likely an employee will stay with the company and what factors may be relevant 
on why or why not an employee may leave
In conclusion, monthly pay was a relevant factor to determine if an employee stays or leaves in the company
