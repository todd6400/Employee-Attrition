# Employee-Attrition
The purpose of this project was to create a regression model and tree model for a mock company to determine how likely an employee will stay with the company and what factors may be relevant 
on why or why not an employee may leave
In conclusion, monthly income and how long the employees have been working for the company were relevant factors to determine if an employee stays or leaves in the company as they had a negative correlation with Attrition.
After a monthly income of around $3750, employees seems less likely to leave the company. The company should possibly increase the monthly income to $3750 for new employees they want to keep. 
After 10 years it seems very likely employees will stay.
